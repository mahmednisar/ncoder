-------------------------Use case of tuple in python----------------------------


-->The literal syntax of tuples is shown by parentheses (). However, we can also use a tuple packing to do the same, and unpacking to assign its values to a sequence.
-->A tuple is a One - Dimensional Data Structure with indexing only possible row-wise.
-->Tuple has immutable nature. This is a nice feature to have in some data structures where you intend to not make any changes to certain parts. For instance tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries.
-->Tuple being immutable requires less memory space as compared to list.
-->Using a tuple can give the programmer and the interpreter a hint that the data should not be changed.
-->Tuples are commonly used as the equivalent of a dictionary without keys to store data. For Example,
	[('Swordfish', 'Dominic Sena', 2001), ('Snowden', ' Oliver Stone', 2016), ('Taxi Driver', 'Martin Scorsese', 1976)]
    Above example contains tuples inside list which has a list of movies.
-->Reading data is simpler when tuples are stored inside a list. For example,
	[(2,4), (5,7), (3,8), (5,9)]
-->Tuple can also be used as key in dictionary due to their hashable and immutable nature.
