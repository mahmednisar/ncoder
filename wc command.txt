-------Find no of lines and words from a file which is not saved but in RAM:--------


-> wc command is used for word count .
-> It is used to find number of lines, word count, byte  and character count in the file specified in the file argument.






Syntax:

Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total line if
more than one FILE is specified.  A word is a non-zero-length sequence of
characters delimited by white space.






Let us consider a file having name f1 containing some text

cat f1.txt


hello
