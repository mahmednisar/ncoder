<----------------To modify the Read and Write permissions from a directory for a root user. -------------->

View:
To view the current permission's for a file or directory we use the command.

ls -l <File/Directory_Name>
eg:ls -l 1.txt
>>-rw-r--r-- 1 ds ds 0 Jun 11 19:38 1.txt

##For this case to modify the Read and Write permissions for a directory from the root user we can have Two approaches:
1.The use of chmod command
2.Removing permission for root all-together.

Option 2 is not favourable in our case as we want to remove permission for only a directory.

##The use of chmod command:

chmod command is used to modify the permission's for files / directories according to users.

To remove the directory permission for a root user we use chmod with - option to remove if any existent permission.

eg: A directory named test is created
then to remove all permissions for the directory we use
chmod 000 ~/test    --->Removes permission for all user's
